### Garfield Kart: Furious Racing Mod Loader
A tool to simplify the process of loading and unloading custom patches and mods for GKFR.
#### Usage
1. Download [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)
2. Create a local folder to store unloaded mod files (e.g. Documents/GarfMods)
3. Locate your GKFR install folder (in Steam, right click GKFR, Manage -> Browse local files)
4. Click on the gkfr_mod_loader_gui file to launch.
5. Click Settings and fill in the two paths found in steps 2 and 3.
6. Click Install BepInEx and find the zip file you downloaded in step 1.
7. Load the mod files you want active for your next session.
8. Launch GKFR and your selected mod files will be automatically patched into the game.

- Do not store any files only in the BepInEx directory within the GKFR install folder. The Remove BepInEx button will delete everything in there.
